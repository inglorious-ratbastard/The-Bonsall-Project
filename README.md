##### Live Development Version: <br> https://inglorious-ratbastard.github.io/The-Bonsall-Project/
##### **About This Repo:**
The original concept was to build something modern and flashy but not overdone to be submitted as part of a hackathon. It was left an incomplete template after discovering about the passing of a good friend. The project then became his namesake dedicated to depression awareness and suicide prevention.  
##### In Memory of John Bridger Bonsall (1989 - 2019)
##### In Memory of Ethan Ryan Skipper (1997 - 2021)
